**Curse of dimensionality**


**No free lunch theorem**
In real-word there are techniques better for a lot of datasets. 

**Random Forest**
- Regressor: predict continuous variables
- Classifier: predict categorical variables


- ??: gives source code
- ?:  gives docs


pd.read_csv(, parse_dates=[])
parse_dates: converted into date_time

sales_time.dt...


- train_cats: same mapping between of categorical variable between train and validation datasets

- order does not make much difference

- For RF its more like I am in Medium rather than low or high 
- How will order help in RF
- -1 for na


Date-Time: depending on what you are doing
- mont, date, year
- day of week
- week of month
- Quarter 
- Weekend
- Holiday 
- was it raining etc.. (dpepending on what you are doing)


**Python attribute**
getattr()
